  <h1 style="border-bottom: none; margin-top: 10px;">Hey! I'm Alejandro ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>
I'm a software developer with over 4 years of coding experience, including 2+ years of professional work in web development. I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I'm open to new opportunities that allow me to expand my skills and knowledge.
</p>

<p>MMy primary stack includes React (with a focus on Next.js), Node.js, and TypeScript.</p>

<p>
  While I have a strong preference for front-end development, I also enjoy working on the back-end, especially within the JavaScript ecosystem.
